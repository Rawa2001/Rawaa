                    <p class="lead">My name is Rawa Ahmed Almokbily,
                        and I am currently a 21-year-old chemical
                        engineering student at Khalifa University.
                        One of the core principles that I live by
                        is that every person has a purpose in life.
                        I know that I was put on this earth for a reason,
                        therefore, I aspire to make a significant impact
                        in the world and I desire to give back to society
                        and make my loved ones proud. I want to be remembered
                        for the things I did and the difference I created in this world

                <h5>Marketing Positioning Statement</h5>
                </br>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">As a chemical engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in promoting
                    a clean,
                    sustainable environment, I am an ideal candidate for graduate schools seeking a motivated and
                    hardworking engineer. I am currently pursuing an environmental track at Khalifa University,
                    where most of the technical electives I am taking are environment-courses. Therefore, I would
                    be able to contribute my knowledge and skills in chemical engineering, and the field of
                    environment. Moreover, I possess a determined and strong willed personality that enables me
                    to preserve through challenges without giving up easily.</p>

                <h1>My definition of success</h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">In my opinion, success is not about getting what I want exactly, because this is not usually what
                    happens easily. As long as I learn from my mistakes, and as long as I keep going without giving
                    up,
                    I would consider myself successful.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">During my first year, I was struggling 
                        so hard with most of my courses. I 
                        studied so hard for the exams, but 
                        I still ended up getting a grade 
                        lower than what I was hoping for. 
                        My GPA started getting lower and 
                        all I wanted to do was to drop 
                        out of university. However, I 
                        decided not to give up and try 
                        as hard as I can to improve . 
                        The next semester, I changed my 
                        style of studying and made sure 
                        to organize everything and visit 
                        my doctor’s office. I continued 
                        like this for the whole semester, 
                        and thankfully, my gpa got higher 
                        and I felt really proud of myself 
                        at that time.

                <h1>4. Risk Mitigation Plan</h1>
                <p>My original plan is to get my master’s
                    degree from Stanford University as soon
                    as I graduate from college. To achieve
                    this goal, I would have to first volunteer
                    and apply for an internship in environmental organizations
                    to gain more knowledge and improve my skills.
                </p>
                <h1>5. Contingency Plan</h1>
                <p>If I do not get accepted to Stanford University, I will consider applying for a temporary job abroad
                    in my
                    field of study. This will help me gain more experience and prepare for future opportunities.
                    After
                    gaining some experience, I will come back to Dubai and complete my master's degree at the
                    American
                    University of Sharjah.</p>
                <h1>6. Failures</h1>
                <p>One big failure I have experienced is when I got rejected by Mohammed bin Rashid University of
                    Medicine and Health Sciences because I failed their entrance exam. Although this failure was
                    difficult to accept at first, I have now realized that pursuing chemical engineering is more
                    suitable for me. I feel like this is where I belong and where I can show my potential.</p>

                <h1>My Father</h1>
                <p>My first and main mentor is my father. My father has always believed in me since I was a
                    child, and he always thought I would grow up to be a very successful person. He himself
                    is such a successful man who loves his job more than anything. What amazes me is that
                    he never had access to education, and he started working since he was 10 years old.
                    However, he still managed to grow up and become a successful business man. I look at my father and
                    I see determination and success, he was the one who taught me that nothing is impossible.

                <p>My second mentor is Dr.Faisal Al Marzooqi. 
                    Dr Faisal Al Marzooqi is an assistant 
                    professor of Chemical Engineering of 
                    the Chemical Engineering department at 
                    Khalifa University. I never really enjoyed 
                    my major until I took a course with him; his 
                    way of teaching is what brings out the best 
                    in all of his students. I have always admired 
                    how passionate he was about his subject and 
                    how dedicated he was to his work. Also, he 
                    always thought I was one of his excellent 
                    students which encouraged me into doing my 
                    best in everything.

                     He is a computer programmer, 
                     and I have always been fascinated 
                     by his passion towards programming. 
                     Every time I have had the chance 
                     to look at him work, I have been 
                     impressed by his creative approaches 
                     to program anything. His commitment 
                     to his profession is very admirable, 
                     and I am grateful that I was able to 
                     learn from him some stuff. He has a great 
                     enthusiasm for programming, and it really 
                     has affected me in a positive way.
