                        solutions to challenging issues and streamlining chemical procedures.
                        I am able to design, develop, and put into practice cutting-edge solutions
                        that address the unique needs of numerous businesses because to my
                        comprehensive knowledge of chemistry, physics, and mathematics.
                        I am able to examine data, spot trends, and come to well-informed
                        conclusions that enhance effectiveness, quality, and safety
                        because of my careful attention to detail. I am devoted to quality,
                        have a great work ethic, and am inherently curious, making me a
                        valued member of any team. I work best in teams, and always willing
                        to collaborate with others to accomplish our shared objectives.

                <h5>Marketing Positioning Statement</h5>
                </br>
                <p style="text-align: left;">As a chemical engineering undergraduate with a strong interest in promoting
                    a clean,
                    sustainable environment, I am an ideal candidate for graduate schools seeking a motivated and
                    hardworking engineer. I am currently pursuing an environmental track at Khalifa university,
                    where most of the technical electives I am taking are environment-related. Therefore, I would
                    be able to contribute my knowledge and skills in chemical engineering, and the field of
                    environment. Moreover, I possess a determined and strong willed personality that enables me
                    to preserve through challenges without giving up easily.</p>

                <h1>1. Milestones and Checkpoints</h1>
                <p>In my opinion, success is not about getting what I want exactly, because this is not usually what
                    happens easily. As long as I learn from my mistakes, and as long as I keep going without giving
                    up,
                    I would consider myself successful.</p>
                <h1>2. Internal Factors</h1>

                    <li>I doubt myself</li>
                    <li>Fear of failure or not being good enough</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Self motivation</li>
                    <li>Self discipline</li>

                </ul>
                <h3>Positive</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a high demand for environmental engineers</li>
                    <li>Following the environmental track in KU</li>
                    <li>Having the required GPA</li>

                <h1>4. Risk Mitigation Plan</h1>
                <p>My original plan is to get my master's degree from Stanford University. To achieve this goal, I
                    will
                    keep applying for internships and volunteer as much as possible to gain more knowledge and
                    improve
                    my skills. In case I do not get accepted, I will consider applying to the University of
                    Queensland
                    or other universities that offer similar programs. I will also explore other career
                    opportunities in
                    my field of study to gain more experience and prepare for future opportunities.</p>
                <h1>5. Contingency plan</h1>
                <p>If I do not get accepted to Stanford University, I will consider applying for a job abroad in my
                    field of study. This will help me gain more experience and prepare for future opportunities.
                    After
                    gaining some experience, I will come back to Dubai and complete my master's degree at the
                    American
                    University of Sharjah.</p>
                <h1>6. Failures</h1>
                <p>One big failure I have experienced is when I got rejected by Mohammed bin Rashid University of
                    Medicine and Health Sciences because I failed their entrance exam. Although this failure was
                    difficult to accept at first, I have now realized that pursuing chemical engineering is more
                    suitable for me. </p>

                <h1>My Father</h1>
                <p>My first and main mentor is my father. My father has always believed in my since I was a
                    child, and he always thought I would grow up to be a very successful person. He himself
                    is such a successful man who loves his job more than anything. What amazes me is that
                    he never had access to education, and he started working since he was 10 years old.
                    However, he still managed to grow up and become a successful, business man. I look at
                    my father and I see success, and I get really motivated.</p>
                <h1>Dr.Faisal Al Marzooqi</h1>
                <p>My second mentor is Dr.Faisal Al Marzooqi. Dr Faisal Al Marzooqi is an assistant
                    professor of Chemical engineering of the chemical engineering department at Khalifa
                    University. I never really enjoyed my major 
                    until I took a course with him, I have
                    always admired how passionate he was about his subject, and how dedicated he was to
                    his work; his way of teaching makes most of the students seem
                    interested. He always thought I was one of his excellent students which encouraged me
                    into doing my best in everything.</p>
                <h1>Jawad ali</h1>
                <p>My uncle Jawad Ali is an individual who has greatly inspired me. 
                    He is a computer programmer and his creativity and passion 
                    for programming have always impressed me. Whenever 
                    I have had the chance to work with him, I have been amazed 
                    at his innovative solutions to complex problems. His attention 
                    to detail is impressive, and he has a unique ability to approach 
                    challenges in a way that allows him to find creative solutions that 
                    others may not have considered. Jawad's dedication to his craft is 
                    truly inspiring, and I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to 
                    learn from him. His enthusiasm for programming is contagious, and it 
                    has encouraged me to strive for excellence in my own work. Overall, 
                    Jawad Ali's talent, creativity, and commitment to his craft make him an 
                    inspiration to me and many others in the programming community.</p>
